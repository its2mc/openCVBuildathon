<h1>PROJECT GUIDE</h1>
The aim of these pilot projects is to show how opencv and imaging in general can be used as a dynamic sensor to control different hardware components <br/>
<u><b>Project 1</u></b>:  This project detects faces from a live camera capture, and toggles an led on and off when a face is detected.

<u><b>Project 2</u></b>:  This project extends project 1 by adding an rgblcd screen that gives a count of the number of faces detected.

<u><b>Project 3</u></b>:  This project not only detects faces, but it gets the centre of the face and uses that information to calculate the distance in pixels the face has moved from its previous position.
